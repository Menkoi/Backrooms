## Description
My final project for Harvard CS50 course is a small 3D game loosely based off of the backrooms creepypasta. The game is in first person and uses the mouse and WASD keys to move around the world. 

The goal is to find the Walter sphere and using the physics engine, bump walter into the hidden cube.

**Tip: Not all walls are made the same**

## Instructions
